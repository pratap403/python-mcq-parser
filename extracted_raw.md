declared globally to tell the compiler about function
name, function parameter and return type. Hence the
above statement is true.
Statement (ii) In 'C' language the parameter list must not
differ in function calling and function declaration. If it
would be separated from function then function cannot
be it. That is we should pass the same parameters as the
function declared in the program. The function can be
called form anywhere in the program. Hence the above
statement (i) & (ii) are true.

(b) Only inside the {} block
(c) Inside the main function
(d) More than one of the above
(e) None of the above
**Bihar TGT TRE, 09.12.2023**
**Ans.(b):** The scope of the variables decreased in the
user defined function is only inside the { } block.
**278.** **Consider the following function definition in a**
**C language:/**
**int f(int x, int y)**
**{x = x+y; y = x-y; x=x-y; print("%d, %d", x,**
**y);}**
**If the function is called as f (3, 9) in the main**
**program, then what will be output?**
(a) 3, 9 (b) 12, 9
(c) 3, 12 (d) 9, 3
**Bihar TGT TRE, 09.12.2023**
**UPPCL AC 2019 (Exam Date 29.01.2019)**
**Ans. (d) :** If the function is called as f(3,9) then the
function int f(intx, inty) is passed as (x = 3, y = 9)
So,

x = x + y
x = 3 + 9
x = 12
Now 12 will assign in x
So,

x = 12, y = 9
y = x – y
y = 12 – 9
y = 3
Now 3 will assign in y again

x = 12, y = 3
x = x – y
x = 12 – 3
x = 9
Hence x = 9 and y = 3 will be shown as output. This
program is called swapping .

**printf ("%d", i);**
(a) 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 (b) 6
(c) 5 (d) 1,2,3,4,5
**(UPPCL RO/ARO-2014)**
**Ans : (b)** C program code
int i = 0;
for (; i < = 5; i++)2
printf ("% d", i);
In the above code, the result will be reassigned to i by
adding 1 to the value of i in each interaction, this
process will continue till the condition (i< = 5) is turn.
Since the print statement is outside the loop, i = 5+1 = 6
will be printed based on the post increment.

**data structure?**
(a) Queues (b) Doubly linked list
(c) Binary tree (d) Circular list
**NVS PGT 19.09.2019 (Shift-I)**
**Ans. (c) :** The above program is a binary tree data
structure. A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data
structure in which each parent has at most two children.
Each node in a binary tree has a left and a right
referencing data element. The node at the top of the
tree's hierarchy is called the root node. The node
containing the other sub-nodes is the parent node.


A parent node has two child nodes, the left child and the
right child. Hashing, for network traffic, data
compression. creating binary heaps. Binary search trees
are some applications that use binary trees.
**286.** **What is the output of the following C program**

(c) b < = c and a < = b (d) b > c
**NVS PGT 19.09.2019 (Shift-I)**
**Ans. (b) :** The given program fragment is without
braces, but it is equivalent to braces. Which are as
followsif (a > b)
{
if (b > c) {s1;}
else {s2;}
}
For S2 to execute it must be i (a > b) true and (b > c)
false i.e. b < = c.


Hence a > b and b < = c will be the right answer.

Either all the functions of the transaction are performed
none of them are performed. There are no partial
transactions. For example, if a transaction starts
updating 100 rows, but after 20 updates the system fails,
the database rolls back the changes to these 20 rows.
This is called atomicity.
